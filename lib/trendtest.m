% Perform within-subjects linear contrast analysis (linear trend test). Takes
% Data in matrix form where lines represent the subjects with the data of
% severeal factors represented by columns. Returns P-value for given data
% and a direction variable indicating whether the data is numerically
% monotonically increasing [1] or decreasing [-1] or is not monotonic [0]
