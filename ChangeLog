	* func/plot_erp.m: Auto scaling for bar diagrams in statistics
	mode was not carried out for figures with indices higher than
	one. This is now fixed.

2014-04-15  Martin Reiche  <reiche.stud@googlemail.com>

	* lib/runningStat.m: Does the statistics only if enough (more than
	2) factor levels are available.

	* func/ssplot.m (ssplot): Fixed a bug for overlapping legend and
	erp plot.

	scaling function.

2014-04-08  Martin Reiche  <reiche.stud@googlemail.com>

	* lib/trendtest.m: Implemented additional output argument holding
	the correlation coefficient for the relationship of the mean data
	and the model coefficients. Is later used to color-code the
	significance bars.

	* lib/subplotERP.m: Implemented changes for single subject ERP
	plotting.

	* lib/runningStat.m: Implemented changes for directional
	color-coding of significance bars of point-wise statistics.

	* lib/drawSig.m: Implemented changes for directional
	color-coding of significance bars of point-wise statistics. If a
	linear trend test is performed the color bars indicating a
	significant trend are now color coded. Red if a positive
	correlation of the mean data and the linear model is at hand and
	blue if the correlation is negative.

	* func/ssplot.m: Added. New function which allows to plot the
	single subject ERPs of one stimulus type within one plot. Can be
	called with a button labelled 'Single Subjects' in the single
	(clicked) ERP plots.

	* lib/getDisp.m: Replaced functions in order to work without
	vec2mat which is only available in the Communication System
	Toolbox.

	* lib/distinct_color.m: Changed order of output colors in a more
	plausible way.

2014-04-07  Martin Reiche  <reiche.stud@googlemail.com>

	* README: Added description of new functions and options.

	* func/getMax.m: Standardized channel location access for data
	with different raw file type.

	* func/chanLoc.m: Standardized channel location access for data
	with different raw file type.

	* lib/subplotERP.m: Changed running statistics routines.

	* func/plot_erp.m (plot_erp): Changed running statistics routines.

	* config.m: Added linear trend test as option for running
	point-wise statistics of ERPs.

	* lib/runningStat.m: Implemented linear trend test.

	* lib/drawSig.m: Marking of significant intervals is now handled
	in this file. Significant intervals are now marked in
	light red for p-values which are not corrected for multiple
	comparisons and in dark red for tests which have been corrected
	for multiple comparisons.

	* lib/trendtest.m: Newly implemented within-subjects contrast
	test. Added as option for running point-wise statistics to
	operform a linear trend test of the submitted data.

2014-03-03  Martin Reiche  <reiche.stud@googlemail.com>

	* eeg_analysis.m (eeg_analysis): Loading chanlocs from local
	results folder.

	* func/preprocess.m: paths are submitted to func/checkFile.m to
	check whether which cluster mode is active.

	* func/checkFile.m (checkFile): In remote cluster mode, script is
	not paused if trigger timing exceedes expected value.

2014-02-11  Martin Reiche  <reiche.stud@googlemail.com>

	* func/preprocess.m: Job subfolder of results path gets deleted
	after the last subject was preprocessed.

	* func/eeg_rejection.m: Implemented new channel location path.

	* func/save_erp.m: Implemented now channel location path.

	* eeg_analysis.m: In parallel mode an additional subfolder
	indicating the Job ID is now appended to the results path where
	temopral data files are stored throughout the preprocessing.

	* config.m: An additional path for the channel location file is
	now included separately from the results path because this now
	gets modified with an additional job subfolder in parallel mode.

2014-02-10  Martin Reiche  <reiche.stud@googlemail.com>

	* triggerlabels.m (triggerlabels): Added additional argument
	indicating condition number for retriggering routine.

	* func/eeg_rejection.m: Fixed a bug in the epoching routine for
	selecting multiple events in one block.

	* func/change_trig.m: There was a bug in the retrigger
	routine. Fixed. Function needs one more argument now indicating
	the number of the condition of the current block in order to work.

2014-02-07  Martin Reiche  <reiche.stud@googlemail.com>

	* lib/subplotERP.m (subplotERP): Plotting of component markers,
	significant intervals and baseline markers for the single-clicked
	ERP plots were in wrong layer order. Fixed.

2014-02-06  Martin Reiche  <reiche.stud@googlemail.com>

	* eeg_analysis.m (eeg_analysis): New method for displaying usable
	data per subject implemented. When calling
	eeg_analysis(task,subjects,'usabledata',threshold) the user now
	gets prompted to select an ERP file and the amount of usable data
	per subject as well as the amount of usable data overall for the
	current ERP file is displayed. A rejection threshold for an
	acceptable amount of usable data must be given. Subjects below
	this threshold are marked for rejection. A vector of subject
	numbers still within the acceptable threshold is
	returned. Depending on the method specified when calling
	eeg_analysis the output arguments variably change. 'submitJob' and
	'getJob' return the scheduler and job handle, 'plot' returns
	nothing and 'usabledata' returns vector of subject numbers above
	the given threshold of acceptable usable data.
	
	* config.m: Trigger configuration parameters were not called
	correctly. Fixed.

	* func/usabledata.m: Added. Function displaying the amount of
	usable data for a given ERP file. Gets called by eeg_analysis.m
	with 'method' usable data and given rejection threshold in
	percent. All subjects' usable data is displayed, subjects below
	the threshold are marked for rejection. Vector of subject numbers
	still within the acceptable threshold is returned.

	* triggerlabels.m (triggerlabels): Added option trig.changeLat
	where a duration in milliseconds can be specified by which all
	triggers get shifted. If the duration is negative all triggers get
	shifted back in time by the given duration and if it is positive
	the triggers get delayed by the specified duration.

	* func/change_trig.m (change_trig): Implemented trigger latency
	correction procedure. Allows the user to shift the latency of all
	triggers by given duration in milliseconds if a constant stimulus -
	trigger latency was present during recording. The duration of the
	latency shift can be specified in the variable
	trig.changeLat in the file triggerlabels.m.

2014-02-05  Martin Reiche  <reiche.stud@googlemail.com>

	* eeg_analysis.m: Controls the whole preprocessing and plotting
	routines. Handles parallel job submission and job data
	retrieval. In serial mode it submits single subjects to
	preprocessing routine and combines resulting data of several
	subjects. In parallel mode, creates scheduler, gathers file and
	path dependencies, submits jobs to schedulers and retrieves job
	data from scheduler if the jobs are finished. It returns scheduler
	and job handles in parallel mode and determines resources for
	remote cluster job submission.

	* config.m: Several minor changes: deviant triggers for later
	exclusion of events around those triggers are now specified here
	as compared to earlier versions. retrigConf.m was deleted.

	* func/preprocess.m: Now the whole preprocessing routine is
	handled by this function. Nothing really changes except, that each
	subject is now processed separately and the preprocessed data is
	returned by preprocess.m which gets combined later by save_erp.m.o

	* channelInterp.m: Configurations for channel interpolations for
	given subjects is now handled in this file.

	* triggerlabels.m: Retriggering is now also specified here. In
	earlier versions this was configured in /func/retrigConfo.m which
	was now dropped. Unwanted events can now also be specified here
	which then get removed shortly after raw data was loaded.

	* func/loadRawData.m (loadRawData): Reference channel is now
	removed after loading of raw data because that caused trouble when
	rejecting flat epochs (Reference channel consisted of zeros only)

	* lib/subplotERP.m: Plotting of significant intervals in single
	clicked ERP plot implemented.

	* lib/runningStat.m: Now check plausibility of stats window. If
	stats window is exceeding the epoch range, the stats window is
	adapted to the epoch length.

	* func/singleERP.m: Only plots ERP plot in full screen (without
	bar diagram) if no statistics window for running stats is
	available. If it is available, now the significant intervals are
	also displayed in the single clicked ERP plots.

	* func/save_erp.m: Major changes: writing of usable data log files
	is now performed here instead of eeg_rejection.m, a summary usable
	data file is now created as well reporting the overall usable data
	usable data of each subject. Several pieces of meta information
	are now also written out to usable data log files.

	* func/reReference.m: re-referencing was accidentally not
	performed against re-reference channel or average of re-reference
	channels but against average of all scalp channels. Fixed.

	* func/prepSubDir.m: fixed minor bug with indexing of subject
	number.

	* func/plot_erp.m: Component windows are now checked for
	plausibility and windows with ranges exceeding the epoch are
	ignored.

	* func/getMax.m: Eye channels are now ignored for determination of
	maximal values.

	* func/eeg_rejection.m: Now returns amount of usable data per
	subject as variable and does not write information in usable data
	files anymore. This routine is now handled by save_erp.m

	* func/checkFile.m (checkFile): Fixed Bug in trigger latency check
	routine. Alert function was broken that warned the user if
	predefined amount of triggers was exceeding predefined latency
	range. Now excludes all triggers as specified in variable
	trig.delete in triggerlabels.m and not only 'boundary' events
	anymore.

	* func/change_trig.m: Trigger codes of deviant, target and
	responses for trigger exclusion are now configured in config.m and
	not here anymore

	* func/calc_diff.m: Now opens a loading GUI if no preprocessed ERP
	file is found in the specified results folder.

2013-11-28  Martin Reiche  <reiche.stud@googlemail.com>

	* func/prepSubDir.m: Fixed a minor bug in the check procedure of
	availability of raw data.

	* func/checkFile.m (checkFile): Added conversion of old triggers
	(EEG.urevent) to strings.

2013-11-27  Martin Reiche  <reiche.stud@googlemail.com>

	* func/plot_erp.m: Error bars are only plotted when there is more
	then one subject. Otherwise meaningles to plot SEM, computes SEM
	anyway due to dimension reshaping if erpAll contains only one
	subject. Hence the new behavior. 

	* func/prepSubDir.m: Fixed minor bug. Was unable to read raw data
	folders of available subjects.

	* func/save_erp.m: Fixed a bug concerning concatenating procedure
	of erp structure when perfroming additional
	analyses. erp.path.allFiles won't be saved anymore because it only
	contains data of the subject which was processed at last.

	* func/reReference.m: Added. Perform rereferencing before
	calculation of difference waves and plotting procedure. Can be
	enabled and disabled in config by variable analysis.reref. New
	reference channel is specified in variale analysis.rerefChan. If
	several channels are specified as reference channel, the
	rereferencing will be carried out against the average of the
	specied rereference channels.

2013-11-25  Martin Reiche  <reiche.stud@googlemail.com>

	* func/calc_diff.m: Implemented optional rereferencing before
	baseline correction.

	* config.m: Added settings for rereferencing procedure.

	as strings. Added multi trigger selection routines.
 
	* eeg_analysis.m (eeg_analysis): BioSig and Brainvision raw data
	routines were merged. All triggertypes are now handled as strings
	shortly after loading.

	* func/checkFile.m (checkFile): Added. checkFileBioSig and
	checkFileBv were merged to that file.

2013-11-18  Martin Reiche  <reiche.stud@googlemail.com>

	* lib/subplotERP.m (subplotERP): Implemented marking of
	significant intervals determined by lib/runningStat.m

	R.A. Trujillo-Perez. (2004). RMAOV1:One-way repeated measures
	ANOVA. A MATLAB
	file. (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange)

	* func/plot_erp.m (plot_erp): implemented point-by-point running
	rmanova on ERP data
