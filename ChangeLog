	* func/reReference.m: Added. Perform rereferencing before
	calculation of difference waves and plotting procedure. Can be
	enabled and disabled in config by variable analysis.reref. New
	reference channel is specified in variale analysis.rerefChan. If
	several channels are specified as reference channel, the
	rereferencing will be carried out against the average of the
	specied rereference channels.

	* func/calc_diff.m: Implemented optional rereferencing before
	baseline correction.

	* config.m: Added settings for rereferencing procedure.

	* func/segmentation.m (segmentation): Adjusted triggers to be
	handled as strings. Added multi trigger selection routines.

	* func/save_erp.m (save_erp): Adjusted triggers to be handled as
	strings. Added multi trigger selection routines.

	* func/retrigConf.m (retrigConf): Adjusted triggers to be handled
	as strings. Added multi trigger selection routines.

	* func/eeg_rejection.m (eeg_rejection): Adjusted triggers to be handled
	as strings. Added multi trigger selection routines.

	* func/bipolarize.m (bipolarize): Adjusted triggers to be handled
	as strings. Added multi trigger selection routines.

	* eeg_analysis.m (eeg_analysis): BioSig and Brainvision raw data
	routines were merged. All triggertypes are now handled as strings
	shortly after loading.

	* func/checkFile.m (checkFile): Added. checkFileBioSig and
	checkFileBv were merged to that file.

	* lib/subplotERP.m (subplotERP): Implemented marking of
	significant intervals determined by lib/runningStat.m

	* lib/runningStat.m (runningStat): Included. Handles the whole
	point-by-point rmanova procedure for a given ERP plot.

	* lib/fdr.m: Included. Takes vector of p-values and returns new
	p-value significance treshold.

	* lib/OneWayrmAoV.m: Included. Calculates a one way repeated
	measures ANOVA for each datapoint on given channel data. Returns
	p-values for each test. The Script is based on - RMAOV1 -
	Trujillo-Ortiz, A., R. Hernandez-Walls and
	R.A. Trujillo-Perez. (2004). RMAOV1:One-way repeated measures
	ANOVA. A MATLAB
	file. (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange)

	* func/plot_erp.m (plot_erp): implemented point-by-point running
	rmanova on ERP data

	* config.m (config): added setting for point-by-point running
	rmanova on ERP data

	* triggerlabels.m: minor configuration changes

	* config.m: minor configuration changes

	* README: Added description of newly implemented scripts

	* eeg_analysis.m: minor changes and inclusions to implement batch
	mode and basic plotting routines.
