	* func/segmentation.m (segmentation): Adjusted triggers to be
	handled as strings. Added multi trigger selection routines.

	* func/save_erp.m (save_erp): Adjusted triggers to be handled as
	strings. Added multi trigger selection routines.

	* func/retrigConf.m (retrigConf): Adjusted triggers to be handled
	as strings. Added multi trigger selection routines.

	* func/eeg_rejection.m (eeg_rejection): Adjusted triggers to be handled
	as strings. Added multi trigger selection routines.

	* func/bipolarize.m (bipolarize): Adjusted triggers to be handled
	as strings. Added multi trigger selection routines.

	* eeg_analysis.m (eeg_analysis): BioSig and Brainvision raw data
	routines were merged. All triggertypes are now handled as strings
	shortly after loading.

	* func/checkFile.m (checkFile): Added. checkFileBioSig and
	checkFileBv were merged to that file.

	* lib/subplotERP.m (subplotERP): Implemented marking of
	significant intervals determined by lib/runningStat.m

	* lib/runningStat.m (runningStat): Included. Handles the whole
	point-by-point rmanova procedure for a given ERP plot.

	* lib/fdr.m: Included. Takes vector of p-values and returns new
	p-value significance treshold.

	* lib/OneWayrmAoV.m: Included. Calculates a one way repeated
	measures ANOVA for each datapoint on given channel data. Returns
	p-values for each test. The Script is based on - RMAOV1 -
	Trujillo-Ortiz, A., R. Hernandez-Walls and
	R.A. Trujillo-Perez. (2004). RMAOV1:One-way repeated measures
	ANOVA. A MATLAB
	file. (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange)

	* func/plot_erp.m (plot_erp): implemented point-by-point running
	rmanova on ERP data

	* config.m (config): added setting for point-by-point running
	rmanova on ERP data

	* triggerlabels.m: minor configuration changes

	* config.m: minor configuration changes

	* README: Added description of newly implemented scripts

	* eeg_analysis.m: minor changes and inclusions to implement batch
	mode and basic plotting routines.
